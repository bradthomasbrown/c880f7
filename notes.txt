have to strip out and clean the lib
we do want to handle overloads or attempt to try that
 handling them and dealing with them now is manual and tedious and goofy
we need to actually deal with the abi library/repository first
 we'll want it to then reference the abi library more directly
 it'll be weird
 you use this to build a module
 but the module won't work unless you've also installed our abi library
 sounds kinda gross, but i don't see a nice way around that
 maybe ask claude what it thinks, there might be some idea or concept or mechanism we don't know about
 --
 it suggested we do exactly what we are already doing
 okay

an example.ts or examples/ is not a bad idea to have in a TS package
